- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vladivostok1703
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning different types of programming language. Right now I'm student at a good university from Romania. I am a person open to everything new, persistent and creative. I like to work alone, but also in collaboration with other people.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ at college, but I have knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS and basic stuff in PHP, SQL and JavaScript.
